I am a Ph.D. researcher in **Industrial & Systems Engineering** at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison**, specializing in **human factors, neuroergonomics, biomechanics, and multimodal physiological data analysis**. My research focuses on understanding and optimizing human performance in complex, human-in-the-loop systems under conditions such as fatigue, cognitive workload, and altered environments.

Currently, I work as a **Graduate Research Assistant** in the NeuroErgonomics Lab, collaborating with the **Neuroscience Laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center**. My work involves designing and executing long-duration human subject experiments and analyzing synchronized multimodal data, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, electromyography (EMG), motion capture, heart rate variability, and force measurements.

Previously, I conducted biomechanics and motion capture research at **Clarkson University**, where I developed musculoskeletal models and datasets to support the design of adaptive exoskeletons for firefighters. I also have academic teaching experience as a **Lecturer in Embedded Systems** and prior industry experience in **corporate banking and scientific research**, providing me with a strong interdisciplinary background.

I am interested in **summer internship opportunities (Summer 2026)** where I can apply data analytics, machine learning, and engineering methods to the design and evaluation of human-centered systems.

My research publications, projects, and technical skills are listed throughout this site.
